# 🏥 Power BI Healthcare Dashboard Project

This Power BI project presents an interactive and insightful dashboard designed to analyze key healthcare metrics. The project focuses on delivering meaningful data visualizations and performance indicators that assist in better decision-making for healthcare operations.

## 🖼️ Project Overview
This project is built on real-world healthcare scenarios, focusing on data extracted from hospital records such as patient admissions, treatment timelines, recovery rates, and departmental performance. The dashboard allows users to interact with filters and slicers for dynamic insights, track KPIs in real time, and drill down into specific categories like age groups, departments, or treatment types. Special attention was given to performance optimization and clean visual storytelling to make data easily understandable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 📊 Features & Tools Used
✅ DAX Measures: Used for dynamic calculations such as patient count, admission rates, average treatment time, etc.

✅ Calculated Columns: Created to derive custom insights from raw data, enabling more powerful visualizations.

✅ KPIs & Metrics: Key healthcare KPIs (e.g., recovery rate, occupancy rate, emergency turnaround time) are displayed clearly.

✅ Charts: Included bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for quick and clear data interpretation.

✅ Scatter Plots: Used to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers in clinical and operational data.

✅ Interactive Dashboard: Fully interactive Power BI dashboard for seamless data exploration and filtering.
